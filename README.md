# learning-python

This repo is dedicated to my journey of learning Python programming. It serves as a personal archive of code snippets, projects, and notes as I explore various aspects of the Python language.

## Contents

- Socket programming
- multithreading (coming soon)

The goal of this repository is to track my progress, share my learning experiences, and potentially help other beginners in their Python journey. Feel free to explore, use, or contribute to any of the content here.
